#+TITLE: IBM Watson Studio projects
#+AUTHOR: phdenzel

These are some of the projects on my IBM cloud account, but adjusted
to run on my local machine (which has a slightly more powerful CPU and
GPU) in a Python 3.8 environment.

- Machine Learning with Python: [[./mlwpy_project.ipynb][mlwpy_project.ipynb]]
- Deep Learning & Neural Networks with Keras: [[./dnnkeras_project.ipynb][dnnkeras_project.ipynb]]
